# improvement of Py04 code:

# b0
#   read (and test) the given class "Chessman" (with name and position)
#   read (and test) the given class "ChessBoard" (which includes a list of chessmen)
#
# b1
#   use Operator - Overloading (__add__, __iadd__,.... to allow
#      adding a chessman to the list of chessmen on a chessboard with operator "+"
#      override operator "+"   to return a copy of a chess-board with chessman added and
#      override operator "+="  to add a chessman to the chess-board) and
#      override operator "==" to compare two games (are all the chessmen on the same locations?)
# b2
#   use multiple inheritance to
#	   create another base class named Shape
#      i.e. a class to "draw" wooden/stone/brick figures
#      (Note: we do not draw anything in 2D, we are just simulating!)
#      method "__str__" ... which returns the shape, color and position
#      but also the used material: "Black wooden Bishop on a3".

# === neither algorithms nor consistency checks required ===
